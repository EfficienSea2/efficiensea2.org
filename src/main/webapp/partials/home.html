            <h1>About EfficienSea2</h1>
            <p>
                The overall objective is to co-create and deploy innovative solutions for safer and more efficient waterborne operations.
                A carefully selected consortium, encompassing excellent technical and human factor competences, equipment,
                system- and service providers as well as authorities and international organisations, with expert domain and
                regulatory knowledge and influence. Supported by a High Level User Group the consortium is in an excellent
                position to maximise the impact of project innovations. With a total of seven specific objectives all interacting
                within one framework, the project targets the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create and implement a ground-breaking <b>communication framework – the ‘Maritime Cloud’</b> that will
                    enhance information sharing in and around the maritime sector for smarter traffic management, facilitating
                    a comprehensive e-maritime and e-navigation environment, enabling the maritime internet of
                    things.</li>
                <li>Identify, develop, test and, where possible, standardise and implement <b>e-navigation solutions</b> that will
                    reduce the risk of accidents, especially in dense waterways, as well as increase the efficiency of the
                    transport chain.</li>
                <li>Develop, test and, where possible, implement <b>e-maritime solutions</b> for <b>automated reporting</b> and <b>efficient
                    port information</b> and, thus, minimise delays and turnaround times as well as administrative burdens.</li>
                <li>Create and implement navigational support services and a new self-organizing <b>emergency response solution</b>
                    in remote and difficult environments such as the Arctic in order to reduce the risk of loss of life.</li>
                <li>Develop solutions to <b>monitor emissions</b> with a focus on SOx and conduct validation trials in the Baltic
                    Sea Region.</li>
                <li>Create innovative and cost-effective solutions with <b>novel communication technology</b> to deal with ships’
                    challenge of getting access to information services at a reasonable price, especially in remote places such
                    as the Arctic.</li>
                <li><b>Set the technical and governance standard</b> for the above areas, particularly in regards to e-navigation
                    solutions.</li>
            </ol>
